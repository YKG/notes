# Linux

### 文件系统

- `/usr` 目录
   
   > Pronounced as “user,” but this subdirectory does not contain user files.
   >  `/usr` is a large directory hierarchy that looks a little like the root. 
   > The bulk of the Linux system resides in  `/usr` .
   > The primary reason that the root does not contain the complete system is to **keep space requirements low**.
